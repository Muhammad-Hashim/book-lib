      "shortDescription": "The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy trilogy written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, with much of it being written during World War II, it was originally published in three volumes in 1954 and 1955. It has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into at least 38 languages, becoming one of the best-selling novels ever written.",
      "longDescription": "The Lord of the Rings has been adapted several times for radio, stage, and film. The most well-known adaptation is the Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001â€“2003) directed by Peter Jackson. The films were critically acclaimed and commercially successful, and they helped to introduce Tolkien's work to a new generation of readers and viewers.",

Beginning with coverage of the history of the architecture of web applications, highlighting the uses of the standard web API to create applications with increasingly sophisticated architectures, developers are led through a discussion on the development of industry accepted best practices for architecture.    Described is the history and evolution towards this architecture and the reasons that it is superior to previous efforts. Also provided is an overview of the most popular web application frameworks, covering their architecture and use. Numerous frameworks exist, but trying to evaluate them is difficult because their documentation stresses their advantages but hides their deficiencies. Here, the same application is built in six different frameworks, providing a way to perform an informed comparison. Also provided is an evaluation of the pros and cons of each framework to assist in making a decision or evaluating a framework on your own. Finally, best practices are covered, including sophisticated user interface techniques, intelligent caching and resource management, performance tuning, debugging, testing, and Web services.",

    "longDescription": "You are a Java developer. You are asked to add a simple feature to your application. But \"simple\" can be deceiving: you have to make many changes, in locations which can be difficult to find.    If this sounds familiar, you want to know about Java reflection. With reflection, you can work smarter by designing flexible applications to which you can easily add likely new requirements. Then, with a few code changes in easy-to-find places, you've got the job done. Reflection adds a new dimension to your programming skills. It will boost your effectiveness.    Java Reflection in Action starts from the basics. It gradually builds a complete understanding, adding as it goes reflective concepts illustrated with many small examples that are useful in real applications.    In a subplot, the book follows a programmer, George, as he tackles common but difficult tasks. In each case, George finds flexible, reflective solutions that replace the usual hard-coded ones. The power of reflection becomes clear through his story.",

    "longDescription": "Imagine a different way to program in which you specify rules and facts instead of the usual linear set of instructions. That's the idea behind rule-based programming. A rule engine automatically decides how to apply the rules to your facts and hands you the result. This approach is ideal for expressing business rules and is increasingly used in enterprise computing.    Jess is a popular rule engine written in Java. It's supported by Sandia Labs and has an active online community. If you have a problem that can be solved with rules, Jess in Action will show you how. (If you are not sure, read chapter 2.) Written by the creator of Jess, this book is an accessible and practical guide to rule-based system development in Java.    Jess in Action first introduces rule programming concepts and teaches you the Jess language. Armed with this knowledge, you then progress through a series of fully-developed applications chosen to expose you to practical rule-based development.
